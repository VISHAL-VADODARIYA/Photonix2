                                One of the hardest things to do is selling yourself. Writing about yourself feels awkward
                                and sometimes really cringey. The problem lies in balancing modesty while also presenting
                                your competency and talent. And because of this, some, if not most, freelancers are really
                                having a difficult time writing about themselves.While showcasing your works through
                                portfolios and online pages is perhaps easier in
                                marketing your service, clients will still look for your personal and professional profile.
                                Of course, they want to know who they will be working with. So, it is still advisable and
                                very much recommended that you include information about yourself on your website, social
                                media pages, and other platforms.
